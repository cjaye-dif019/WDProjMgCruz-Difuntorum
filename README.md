Javascript wil be used in order to maintain the voting and leadership board. JS will keep trach of which teacher a user selects using buttons. It will then store that vote temporarily, show a confirmation pop-up after a vote is submitted, then ultimately, update vote counts in real-time on the page. JS will then rank and configure all the votes to display them in an orderly manner on the leaderboard page.
